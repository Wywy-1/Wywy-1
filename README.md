Hello! 

My name is Wyatt. I'm a PhD candidate in Indigenous Studies, I code on my spare time for fun! 
Currently learning Python, I have *some* experience with Java, Javascript, C, C#, and x86 assembly (for debugging C code).

Interested in security, data management/visualization, and making life easier through coding (e.g., automatically grading class participation from zoom data, organizing files automatically on a computer for ease of reference, etc.).
