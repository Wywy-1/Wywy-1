Hello! 

My name is Wyatt. I'm a PhD student in Indigenous Studies and I code on my spare time. 
Currently learning Python, and have some experience with Java, Javascript, C, and C#. 
I can also debug in assembly, but not well.

Interested in computer security, data management/acquisition, and making my life easier through coding (e.g., grading participation from zoom data, organizing contracts on my computer, etc.).
